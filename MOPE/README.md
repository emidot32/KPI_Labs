# Course 2. Methods for optimizing and planning experiments

Different methods of experiment planning using statistical tools were considered in this course.

Languages & libs: `Python`, `numpy`, `scipy`.

Labs:

* lab2 - conducting a two-factory experiment using a linear regression equation.

* lab3 - conducting a three-factor experiment using a linear regression equation.

* lab4 - conducting a three-factor experiment using a regression equation taking into account the effect of interaction.

* lab5 - conducting a three-factor experiment using regression equations taking into account quadratic terms (central orthogonal composition plan).

* lab6 - conducting a three-factor experiment using regression equations with quadratic terms.

Criteries.py - module with various tests (Cochran, Romanovskiy) for models.
