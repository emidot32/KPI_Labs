# Course 3. Real Time Systems

Laboratory work has nothing to do with the name of the subject. The Fourier transforms for a random signal (part 1) and various algorithms (part 2) were considered in this course.

Technologies & languages: `Python`, `Java`, `Android SDK`, `Jupyter Notebook`.

Part 1 (Python):

* lab 1.1 - generating random signal.

* lab 1.2 - calculating correlation for this signal.

* lab 2.1 - Discrete Fourier Transform for the signal.

* lab 2.2 - Fast Discrete Fourier Transform for the signal.

Part 2 (Android):

* lab 3.1 - Ferma algorithm for factoring a number.

* lab 3.2 - stupid neural network.

* lab 3.3 - genetic algorithm for solving diophantine equations.
