# Course 1. Discrete Math labs
Simple graphs algorithms and more. There is used tkinter library for GUI. 

The first 2-3 laboratory work is one of the most voluminous laboratory work during an education.

Lab 1 - typical set operations.

Lab 2 - binary relations and their basic properties and operations on relations. Also using networkx for showing relations.

Lab 3 - basic graph operations and using networkx to display graphs.

Lab 4 - graph coloring algorithms.
