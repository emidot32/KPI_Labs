# Course 4. System Programming Course Work

Language: `Java`

Course work stands for the program that allocate tasks from task graph on processors in multiprocessor system 
with certain topology for achieving minimum time of execution.
I use DeBruine, Hypercube, GRID topologies. The results of modeling were published at http://journals.khnu.km.ua/vestnik/?cat=46

I implemented BSA for this purpose because it shows good results of allocation.
