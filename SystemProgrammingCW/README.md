# Course 4. System Programming Course Work

Language: `Java`

Course work stands for the program that allocate tasks from task graph on processors in multiprocessor system 
with certain topology for achieving minimum time of execution.
I use DeBruine, Hypercube, linear topologies.

I implemented BSA (Bubble Scheduling and Allocation) algorithm for this purpose because it shows good results of allocation.
