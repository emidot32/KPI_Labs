# Course 3. Parallel and Distributed Computing

Each laboratory work is a writing of a parallel program for solving a mathematical expression with matrices and vectors using a given language or tool for parallelism. 

Languages & libs: `Java`, `C#`, `OpenMP`, `MPI` (MPJ Express)

MA, MB, MC... - matrices. 
A, B, C... - vectors. 
a, b, c... - numbers. 

Lab and settlement works:

* lab 1 - parallel program written in C# for calculating expression: MA = min(Z)\*MS - d\*MT\*MR

* lab 2 - parallel program written in Java for calculating expression: A = sort(Z)\*MO + d\*Z\*(MX\*ME) 

* lab 3 - parallel program written in Java using OpenMP lib for calculating expression: A = sort(Z)\*MO + d\*Z\*(MX\*ME) 

* lab 4 - parallel program written in Java using MPI lib (parallel tools with local memory) for calculating expression: A = (B\*MC)\*(MO\*MC) + min(Z)\*R

* rgr - settlement graphic work. But in practice itâ€™s just a comparison of systems with local and shared memory. I compare Java parallel tools and MPI tools.
